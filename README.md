# 🐍 Python Logic Lab: Practical Scripts & Mini-Apps

A collection of lightweight Python projects demonstrating core programming logic, 
problem-solving, and automation. This repository showcases my ability to bridge 
technical code with real-world scenarios—from ATM simulations to data processing tools.

### 🚀 Featured Scripts
* **ATM Simulation:** A robust terminal-based app with transaction logging and error handling.
* **Network Port Scanner:** A multi-threaded utility that probes specific IP addresses for open ports. It demonstrates knowledge of the `socket` library, TCP handshakes, and network diagnostics—essential for technical SEO and web security audits.
* **Data Utility Tools:** Scripts designed to clean and prep data for Excel & Power BI.
* **AI & API Experiments:** Exploring rapid tech innovations through integrated Python libraries.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.12+
* **Core Libraries:** `datetime`, `logging`, `math`
* **Concepts:** Error Handling (Try/Except), File I/O, Data Validation, and Functional Programming.
